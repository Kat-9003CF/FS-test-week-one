# Full Stack Development Test - Week One

This assessment tests your understanding of loops, objects, arrays, and basic functions.

## Guidelines

- In case you copy previously written code, you should be able to explain it on the white board

## Tips

- Use your whiteboard to draw the problem
- Write pseudocode before writing code.

## Self-Assessment

Give yourself a grade for each question. Explain why you gave yourself that grade.

| Grade  | Explanation              |
| :----: | -------------------------|
|   4    | I understood this completely and did not struggle answering it.    |
|   3    | I think I did well, but I didn't totally understand why it worked. |
|   2    | I think I was close, but I didn't get the answer. |
|   1    | I am struggling with this question. |
|   0    | I did not attempt this question (explain why) |

### 1. Palindrome

- Grade:  4
- Explanation:  I was happy with how to reverse a string and compare them so I made the numbers into a string first.  I'm sure there is a neater way to reverse numbers but I used what I knew!

### 2. Add grid items

- Grade: 3/4
- Explanation:  There was some tweaking with 'layers' and the number of brackets, but I knew what I was aiming for and am happy I understand my solution now.  Visualising the grid was the tricky part of this question for me.

### 3. Create file name string in CamelCase

- Grade: 4
- Explanation: I did this a step at a time in pseudocode and it was ok!

### 4. Create pattern

- Grade: 3/4
- Explanation:  Not sure whether I came up with the 'right' solution here, but it does print the pattern so hopefully that's ok!  I came up with a fairly simple solution first but wanted to make my answer look as
close to the brief as possible.

- Overall I was pretty happy with these (and I really hope my solutions are acceptable now I've said that!!).  I had a couple of bits where I had a look at my homework but I was looking for something specific (like the palindrome one - I knew I wanted .split("").reverse().join("") and wanted to check the syntax).
